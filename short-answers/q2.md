# Question

What does it mean when a tag is a "child" of a "parent?".

# Answer

When a tag is the child of a parent it means it is under the umbrella of the parent much like a object and its relationship with its properties/key and values.

Except in this case its more "in-line"

example <parent> <parent> is current just a tag but putting a 2nd tag INSIDE of "parent" makes the 2nd tag the child tag.

<parent><child><child><parent>

This is true, in the future use actual html elements and rather than inline, you would use nested!
