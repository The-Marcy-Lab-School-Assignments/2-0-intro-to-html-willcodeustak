# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
Semantic are easier identifiably labeled while non-semantic is more broad and could lead to mistakes down the line because of the "vastness" their terms cover. 

# Teacher Feedback

This is true, think of non-semantic tags as tags used for grouping!
